there is a bomb on the train, and that he must locate it. More importantly, he must identify the bomber as <br> 
another bombing is expected later that day. He is also told however that he cannot change the past and can only <br>
gather information. As he develops a liking for his traveling companion Christina, he sets out to test that theory.</p>
